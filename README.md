# Grover's Algorithm
### Simulation and analysis
-  Groverâ€™s Algorithm is used for unstructured search problems, providing a quadratic speed up compared to classical algorithms
-  Here we simulate the algorithm and show the workings of the Grover diffuser and Oracle and run the algorithm on an unstructured database
